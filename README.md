# Flask application to view Obsidian notes in web browser
- just point the location of your folder with `.md` notes to app with `NOTES_DIR`

## Configuration

This app uses a `settings.ini` file for configuration. On first run, it will be created automatically if missing, and any missing values will be filled in with defaults.
